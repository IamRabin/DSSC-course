/**
Understanding compiler messages:
Take a simple program (e.g., the hello world one) and put one at a time the following errors. Compile it and try to understand the error messages. If you have both g++ and clang++ compare the messages from the two compilers.
typos in function name (e.g., c0ut)
typos in variable name
forget to put ;
forget to #include <iostream>
declare a variable with illegal name like int double {0};

 */



//#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  c0ut << "Hello Trieste" << endl;
return 0
}


//Typos in variable name,semicolon missing
 //intgr x= 1


 //Forget to include iostream. forgot to include std
 //std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;

 //Pass wrong arguments
  //func_test("Hello");
